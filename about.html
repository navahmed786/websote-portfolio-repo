            <h1>Who am I</h1>
            <p>Currently pursuing a bachelors in Computer science as well as business administration minor. 
                With a strong background in computing science and a keen interest in blending technology with 
                business insights. My journey is marked by a diverse portfolio of projects, honing expertise in 
                programming languages such as Python, C, C++, alongside proficiency in database languages like 
                R-programming and SQL, as well as web development skills encompassing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-ReactJS.
                A dedicated problem solver and enthusiastic team player, my commitment revolves around delivering 
                creative solutions that surpass expectations. I'm deeply driven to collaborate with fellow technology 
                professionals, eager to explore fresh opportunities for continuous growth and professional development.</p>
                
                <br>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy playing and watching basketball. Team sports especially basketball has played a huge role in my life
                in developing confidence as well as learning to work and colloaborate with others. It has also allowed me to 
                develop a strong work ethic and a competitive mindset.
